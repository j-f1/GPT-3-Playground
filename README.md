# GPT-3 Playground

Supports: iOS 16, macOS 12

Play with GPT-3!

To set it up:

1. get an API key (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and paste it into the input at the bottom of the config panel.
2. Create a shortcut named “GPT-3 Logbook” that takes text input and saves it (or comment out the corresponding code in `Completer.swift` if you don’t want that functionality)
